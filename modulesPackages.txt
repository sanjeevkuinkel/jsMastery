What is a Module?
A module is a single file or a collection of files that can be imported or exported to use specific functionality.

Key Characteristics:
Granularity:

A module is a single unit of functionality, typically implemented in a single file.
Example: math.js containing mathematical functions like add, subtract, etc.
Usage:

Modules allow you to split your code into smaller, reusable pieces.
They focus on solving specific problems.
Exports and Imports:

Modules expose specific code (variables, functions, classes) using export.
Other files can use that code via import.


A package is a collection of one or more modules organized together, typically with additional metadata and configuration. Packages are often used for distribution.

Key Characteristics:
Granularity:

A package is a logical group of modules bundled together.
Packages may also include supporting files like documentation, configuration, and build scripts.
Package Manager:

Packages are usually published and distributed using a package manager (e.g., npm for JavaScript).
Example: lodash, a package that includes many utility functions.
Metadata:

Packages have a package.json file that defines metadata (name, version, dependencies, etc.).
